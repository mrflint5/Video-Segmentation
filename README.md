## üìå Abstract

üé• Video segmentation plays a crucial role in fields like video editing, autonomous driving, medical imaging, and surveillance. This research explores and evaluates classical, machine learning, and deep learning-based segmentation techniques.

Key outcomes include:
- üöÄ Transformer models offer **state-of-the-art accuracy**
- üß† CNNs and FCNs are **highly accurate** but computationally expensive
- ‚öôÔ∏è Classical methods are fast but **less robust**
- üìä A detailed comparison using **IoU**, **F1-score**, and **processing time**
